Usage
-----
Simply run the python script in the directory that holds the movies. The movies 
must be in subdirectories, with one movie per directory. Files not in 
directories will be ignored. When renaming, the order in which the files are 
passed to the renamer is platform and locale dependent, so it might not work as 
intended (i.e. renaming the sample file first). Some tweaking might be required.

    cd /dir/with/the/movies
    python /path/to/movie-namer.py
